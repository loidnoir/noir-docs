## What is Noir ?

Initially Noir planned to be private Discord bot for our small community, but as the time past we decided to share and make it more than just a simple private bot. As for now Noir's main goal to provide high quality user-experience for our users. Noir can handle large servers and provide excellent work. Noir is still in very early development and we are working to add new features and make it to work stable.
