Some settings require to use image. You can always use any valid image url but in case you need something specific like the new joined member avatar use built-in variables.

## Image variables

- `{{server icon}}` Server icon URL
- `{{user avatar}}` Joined user avatar URL
- `{{bot avatar}}` Bot avatar URL
