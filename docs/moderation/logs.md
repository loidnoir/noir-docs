Here you can find additional information on how to setup moderation logs.

### Moderation channel

You can choose any channel as long as it is text channel. Noir will create webhook which is also fully customizable. You can use our webhook editor to change message author avatar and username.

:::caution

In case if Noir does not send message check if Noir has permission to send messages in specified channel.

:::

Here are some variables you can use when editing webhook avatar or username

- `{{client avatar}}` Noir avatar
- `{{guild icon}}` Server icon
