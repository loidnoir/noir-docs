## What are logs ?

Wanna get notified with every server activity, enable logs. Logs are advanced messages with information about every action happened in the server, for example if someone creates channel, or uses particular command Noir will report about it with detailed message.

## What are rules ?

Ever wondered how to automate server moderation, than you should use moderation rules. Moderation rules are custom rules created by moderators. If users match them they are automatically getting punishment, for example you can create rule that if user got 3 warnings timeout him 30 minutes.

Moderation rules are still under development and not available yet.
