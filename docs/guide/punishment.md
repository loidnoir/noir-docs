Noir has powerful punishment system. You can warn users and keep track of their infractions.

Use `warn` command to give a warning to user and setup moderation rules to automatically punish them after particular amount of warnings.

Do not forget to provide reason for the warning. Infractions can always be edited or removed by moderators. You can also setup moderation logs get notified about infractions.
